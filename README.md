# Realm-Works-Import
A module to create a compendium pack from a user's RWoutput from the Realm WorksÂ® campaign management tool created by LWD, available from https://www.wolflair.com/realmworks/

You can install the module by updating your module list with the following additional URL: https://github.com/farling42/fvtt-import-realmworks/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Instructions
Simply add this module to your Foundry VTT and enable it within the game into which you want to import your RWoutput information.

In the Compendium panel of the game you will find a new button at the bottom.

Press the button to open a simple dialogue window.

Select an .rwoutput file using the file selector.

Enter the name of the compendium into which the journal entries will be placed (default: "Realm Works").

Maybe modify which options you want to work with.

Press the IMPORT button at the bottom of the window and wait for the contents to be imported.

A new compendium pack with the supplied name will be created, and it will contain one journal entry for each topic that was present in the RWoutput file.

Any parent topic in the RWoutput file will have a list of children at the end of the page which contains links to the child topics.

There is a file limit size of 512 MB for importing (due to a limitation on the maximum allowed size of a string in Javascript).
