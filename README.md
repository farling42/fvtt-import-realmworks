# Realm-Works-Import
A module to create a compendium pack from a user's RWoutput from the Realm WorksÂ® campaign management tool created by LWD, available from https://www.wolflair.com/realmworks/

You can install the module by updating your module list with the following additional URL: https://github.com/farling42/fvtt-import-realmworks/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Instructions
Simply add this module to your Foundry VTT and enable it within the game into which you want to import your RWoutput information.

In the Compendium panel of the game you will find a new button at the bottom called "Realm Works Import".

Press the button to open a simple dialogue window.

Select an .rwoutput file using the file selector.

Enter the name of the folder into which all extracted entries will be placed.

Maybe modify which options you want to work with.

Press the IMPORT button at the bottom of the window and wait for the contents to be imported.

New folders will be created in the Scenes, Actors, Journal and Playlist sections containing the imported data.


Each *Smart_Image* is converted into a scene, with map pins and scene notes connected to the relevant journal entries.

Each *Topic* will be converted into a separate Journal Entry, placed in a sub-folder based on the Category of the topic.

Each *image or embedded file* will be extracted and located in the subdirectory \[data]world/<world-name/realmworksimport

Each *Audio* snippet will be extracted and placed into a Playlist named after the topic.

Each *HL portfolio* will be extracted and Actors created for each character in the portfolio (currently only for PF1 game system). All actors for a single topic are placed into a sub-folder named after the folder.

Any parent topic in the RWoutput file will have a list of children at the end of the page which contains links to the child topics.

## Changelog
0.3.21 Provide a configuration setting to specify the maximum depth of content to display in the Governed Content section of journal entries.

0.3.20 The "Governed Content" will now contain the full hierarchy of descendents rather than only the direct children.
Provide link from Scene Notes journal entry back to the Scene.

0.3.19 Add module configuration setting to set the preferred Actor type when generating Actors from statblocks.
When decoding PF1 Actors, check for presence of "challengerating" element to choose 'npc' Actor type instead of 'character'.
Better fix for HP calculation of PF1 Actors for Actors with multiple types of hit dice.
Create link at start of each Journal Entry to the parent topic. The label for this link is a configurable parameter.

0.3.18 Put HTML in correct place for worlds using the Cypher system (cyphersystem).
When importing a Hero Lab .por file, store just the HTML if the tool doesn't support full Actor creation.

0.3.17 Faster handling of import of data of lots of Actors for different game systems.
Improve PF1 actor creation, especially regarding HP calculation.

0.3.16 Attempt to create Actors regardless of the game system, putting the stat block in the Notes, Biography, or similar named section of the character sheet:
- pf1 - Formatted statblock put into Notes, and also attempts to populate other fields.
- pf2e - Formatted statblock put into Private Notes.
- dnd5e - Formatted statblock put into Biography.
- swade - Formatted statblock put into About/Biography.
- CoC7  - raw HTML of statblock put into biography/Personal Description.
- grpga - raw HTML of statblock put into Main/Notes.
- alienrpg - Formatted statblock put into Description.
- wfrp4e - HTML put into Details/GMNotes.
- pbta - generates an error when creating Actors (system-specific issue), so no Actors will be created.
- anything else - attempt to put into details/biography and biography/personalDescription.

0.3.15 Update README.md with extra information about Actors being placed into sub-folders.

0.3.14 Actors are now put into a sub-folder named after the containing topic (but if there is only one actor in the topic with the same name as the topic, then no sub-folder is created).
The UZIP module is reverted back to its original code (removing export).

0.3.13 Convert .bmp .tif and .tiff images to .png before uploading.
Ensure journal folders are created in the correct parent.

0.3.12 Get it working on Foundry 0.7.x

0.3.11 Update ChangeLog and compatibleCoreVersion to 0.8.8

0.3.10 Fix the default location for uploaded asset files (worlds, not world)

0.3.9 Fix link detection, some spans for links contain class="RWSnippet" rather than just being a plain span.

0.3.8 Core: Remove use of compendiums. Add saving of entered settings. Reduce amount of unnecessary code.
Always expect a top-level folder name to be present.
Hopefully speed up processing time.
Add one entry in "module settings" window of Foundry to support configuring the upload folder for assets (pictures, videos, sounds, etc.).

0.3.7 README.md and FUNDING.yml updated with Ko-Fi link.
Move XML-to-Object function to main module, and pass decoded Object to the game-system specific Actor generator.
PF1: Improve generation of Class Features based on the level of the class; add generation of traits.


0.3.6 Audio snippets are placed into Playlists. One playlist per topic with each Audio snippet as a separate sound within the playlist.

0.3.5 Hopefully faster processing of RW files. PF1 HL decoding has better feat detection, 
correct number of monster levels, and Skill Focus feat modifies the relevant skill.

0.3.4 HL portfolio can be read directly, to import your PF1 characters as Actors. HL portfolios have their minions processed properly.

0.3.3 For PF1 actors, include weapons/armor/ammo/shield items, and improve logic for matching names of other items.
Some attempts at speeding up the code a little.
Decode embedded HL portfolios correctly in the case where a character has minions.

0.3.2 Get Actors and Scenes working on 0.8.6 to the same level as on 0.7.10 (item quantities not working)

0.3.1 Fixed wrong compatibleCoreVersion in module.json

0.3.0 Prevent it generating errors in 0.8.6 (but disable some functionality in order to achieve this)

README.md file updated with current information.
GM-Directions in topics converted to "secret" sections in journal entries.
Snippet styles change the background colour as per RW.

0.2.4 Create an Actor for EACH character in a HL portfolio file, not just the first one.
For PF1 characters, create sub-skills (e.g. Artistry, Perform, Profession).
Include prefix and suffix (if any) from the RW topic in title of journal entries.
Create thumbnails for each scene.
Map pins now include GM-Notes if present, and always includes the pin name.

0.2.3 Support files bigger than 512 MB (but Firefox might not like them)

0.2.1 Only allow loading from a file (no cut/paste any more). Add generation of topic aliases and connection.
Scenes are now created with map pins which are connected to the appropriate journal entries. Because map pins can't link to compendium entries, all journal entries are created in the world.
Create Actors for PF1 and DND5E based on HeroLab portfolio entries; only some fields are decoded.
Journal Entries are grouped under sub-headings of the Category of each of topic.

0.1.3 Initial support for annotations on various fields. Improve layout of tag snippets. Attempt to remove 'null' field titles.
